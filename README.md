### Bikeshare - some insights in sharing data 
Statistics on your fingers tips
### What's this about?
Bikeshare provided data files from three cities they offer their services
- Chicago
- Washington  (unfortunately there are no data about gender and year of birth available)
- New York City

With bikeshare.py you choose the city you want to get some statistics from. Additionally you can choose month and day of week you are interested in. Of course it's also possible to choose all months alls days.
To make it work please ensure you have added the following data files and bikeshare.py in the same directory:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### How to start
Assuming you added bikeshare.py and the data files in directory /py/bikeshare:
```sh
cd /py/bikeshare
python bikeshare.py
```

### Files used
